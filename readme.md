# Arithmeto
Arithmeto is a tool to help teachers engage with there studes in a fun way! 
## functionality
Currently the only buttons that work are the lesson/Challenge buttons, and the nav button to display the 'Nav Links' when the dipslay is small.  
### What are the lessons
The lessons are where you learn. I have gotten help from a liscenced teacher to design small lessons to prepare you for the corresponding challenge.
In the future the lessons will include videos as well as the current 'textbook style' information 
### What are the Challenges 
The challenges are designed to test a student in an engaging way. Uppon answering 10 questions correctly the challenge will display as complete. 
## planned features 
### Design a full curriculum:
The current goal is to create engaging lessons and challenges for the grades K-5. 
### Page to sort by grade: 
In order for an educator to easily search and assign lessons to students, they should be able to view the lessons that the site has to offer from one space.
In this space it will be organized by grade level.
### Page for more units:
Further expanding on the organization, The grades will further be broken down into units. The units are what will be displayed on a single webpage. 
### Abitlity to link accounts for a classroom:  
When a classroom is linked, a leaderboard between classmates will display. It will also give a teacher an space to view all of the students progress so that they can make
professional decisions withtin the classroom. 
### User information: 
in order to track user information a regristration system is needed. Items to be tracked will be an exp tracker, badges/achievements, and profile customization
(such as profile piicture, exp level and badges unlocked)
